#### Project Description

Hello! This repository contains code I used to analyze RNA-Seq data this summer at the Prakriya Lab at Northwestern University.

#### Installation

Make sure you have Rstudio installed and the following libraries: Readxl, Dplyr, Tidyr, Ggplot2

#### Usage

In KOtreated_vs_KOuntreated.R, I was looking at data from two different groups and trying to see the difference in gene regulation (log2FoldChange)
I then subsetted the data to show varying degrees of gene regulation, then put which genes showed a certain ammount of regulation into their according subsets

A similar approach can be found in the other code files. In those files, you can see the code I used to visually represent and compare the amount of gene
regulation present in different genes.

#### Features

My project allows you to deal with large RNA Sequencing data sets, and extract meaning. By analyzing gene regulation patterns, you can identify key genes that are upregulated or 
downregulated. This can be critical for understanding disease mechanisms, discovering potential therapeutic targets, or gaining insights into the effects of specific 
treatments. This project provides a framework for examining RNA-Seq data, making it easier to visualize and interpret genetic information.
