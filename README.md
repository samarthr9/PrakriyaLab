Hello! This repository contains code I used to analyze RNA-Seq data this summer at the Prakriya Lab at Northwestern University.

In KOtreated_vs_KOuntreated.R, I was looking at data from two different groups and trying to see the difference in gene regulation (log2FoldChange)
I then subsetted the data to show varying degrees of gene regulation, then put which genes showed a certain ammount of regulation into their according subsets

A similar approach can be found in the other code files. In those files, you can see the code I used to visually represent and compare the amount of gene
regulation present in different genes.
